        " 1. **Load and Explore Financial News Data:**\n",
        "    - Load a preprocessed dataset of financial news headlines and summaries related to S&P 500 companies.\n",
        "    - Inspect and structure relevant metadata including publication date, ticker, and provider.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. **Build a Custom Vector Store:**\n",
        "    - Combine title and summary text for embedding.\n",
        "    - Implement a vector store from scratch with support for semantic search and optional metadata-based filtering using cosine similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. **Generate and Use Sentence Embeddings:**\n",
        "    - Apply a pre-trained transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to encode text into embeddings for semantic analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. **Perform Semantic Search with Filtering:**\n",
        "    - Retrieve the most relevant news documents for a given query using both full-dataset and metadata-filtered searches.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. **Analyze Semantic Search Results:**\n",
        "    - Interpret and visualize results of search queries (e.g., \"AI announcement\").\n",
        "    - Identify temporal patterns and ticker frequency among top-ranked results.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. **Implement a FAISS-Based Vector Store:**\n",
        "    - Normalize embeddings and use FAISS (IndexFlatIP) to enable efficient similarity search at scale.\n",
        "    - Compare FAISS-based search results with custom vector store results.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. **Critically Compare Search Systems:**\n",
        "    - Evaluate differences in similarity computation, speed, and scalability between custom and FAISS-based systems.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Load Embedding Model\n",
        " - Load the 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model from sentence-transformers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Define CustomVectorStore Class\n",

        " - '__init__': Accepts an embedding model, list of documents, and corresponding metadata. Computes and stores embeddings for all documents.\n",

        "   - If a metadata_filter function is provided, apply it before computing similarity.\n",

        "   - Return the top k results as tuples of: (document, metadata, similarity score).\n",
        "\n",
        " ✅ **Requirements**:\n",
        " - Ensure the number of documents matches the number of metadata entries.\n",

        "- For most queries, the top-5 results from both the `CustomVectorStore` and the FAISS store were **identical or nearly identical**.\n",
        "- Specifically, 4 out of 6 queries showed **100% overlap**, and the remaining 2 showed **80% overlap**.\n",
        "- The **order of the retrieved items** was also mostly consistent, especially for the top-3 results.\n",
        "- **Similarity scores** for the top results were **identical**, suggesting that both systems use the same embedding model and scoring metric (cosine similarity).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Interpretation:\n",
        "- The **high degree of overlap** indicates that the custom implementation of the vector store is functioning correctly and produces comparable results to FAISS.\n",
        "- Minor differences in ranking or result order could be due to:\n",
        "  - Floating-point rounding differences in similarity score computation.\n",
        "  - Slight variations in how vector normalization is handled (FAISS does L2-normalization before indexing).\n",
        "  - Internal implementation details of how tie scores or near-equal similarities are ranked.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Conclusion:\n",
        "- Overall, **no significant differences** were observed in the results between the two systems.\n",
        "- The results validate that the custom vector store is a robust alternative to FAISS for retrieval tasks on this dataset."
